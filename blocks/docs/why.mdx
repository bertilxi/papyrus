# Why Papyrus

As web developer and software engineer, the time goes by, you have ideas and you build a ton of things, some better than others. In the end solving the same problem over and over again stops being fun or challenging.

Added to the complexity of choosing and maintaining some infrastructure for your projects.
You end up slowing down the pace of your creativity and you lose focus of what really matters, the solution, the product.

There are some other problems that also makes me doubt when starting a side project, for example:

- How up to date are this libraries?
- How robust and secure are the libraries I chose?
- Would this cloud platform pricing scale with my project if it becomes commercial?
- Will this cloud platform disappear sometime?
- Will I have vendor lockin?

> The main goal is to solve this problem, stop thinking about the tools and focus only on solving the problem you have.
