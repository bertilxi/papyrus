# Overview

## What is it?

Papyrus is a thin layer on top of the [Deno](https://deno.land) JavaScript runtime, that simplifies the development of web applications, servers and automations. You can build almost anything you want and have it in production effortlessly.

## How is it built?

One of the goals of this project is having the smallest possible core and being able to build itself from that core, the same way a user would do for building their apps.

The main web app in order to be built without having to use cloud resources, uses extra features like folder based routing and auto block generation, something that may be released as a cli in the future if it makes sense.

Papyrus is built around the "Block" primitive, everything is a block, a block can be a:

- Deno module -> `.ts` blocks
- React component -> `.tsx` blocks
- MDX page -> `.mdx` blocks

### Deno modules (.ts blocks)

You can both import or run modules internally or externally.

#### Create modules

You can create modules for being imported, executed or both.

For being imported just export anything as you would do with any ESM.

For execution there is a little convention to follow, an export default with an async function, thats it, you can receive anything and return anything.

```typescript:berti/my-module.ts
interface Props {
  name: string;
}

export default async function main({ name }: Props) {
  console.log(name);

  return `Hello ${name}`;
}
```

#### Importing modules

When you create modules that will be imported in other typescript file, they act as any other Deno module, you can import any public module.

```ts
import myModule from "https://papyrus.sh/s/berti/my-module.ts";

const result = await myModule({ name: "John" });
```

#### Running modules

For running modules you can use the UI or the API or import them in other blocks

```ts
await fetch("https://papyrus.sh/run/berti/my-module.ts", {
  method: "POST",
  body: JSON.stringify({
    name: "John",
  }),
})
  .then((r) => r.json())
  .then((r) => console.log(r));
```

### React components (.tsx blocks)

For this blocks you can create them as pages or for reusing in other components.

#### As pages

In order to work, a config with `page = true` needs to be exported.

By default the pages will be exported as static html, except an interactive feature is used and the platform detects it, currently the detection method is naive and it may fail, it will be improved in the future.

In case you want to use client side JavaScript you can set `interactive = true` in the config;

```tsx
export const config = {
  page: true,
  interactive: true,
};

export default function Home() {
  return <div>Hello world</div>;
}
```

#### As components

The same as for modules, you can export whatever you want.

### Mdx pages (.mdx blocks)

This type of block its useful for documentation and simple interactive content.

You can write markdown and markdown react as you like, import other components, set static or interactive, your choice.
